............ SHELL BASICS...............

Touch : to create 0 byte files

Shell is used to give o/p from user input(eg:keyboard). Which works as secondary interactive kernal using bash


We can do tricky codes using shell as follows

Lets say we have folders like a, ab,abc,abcd.bcs,bcd,bbc etc

   : echo a*   ---> gives the o/p all folders starting with a (NOTE: *is meta charecter)

   : echo "a*"....> same o/p

   : echo 'a*'----> a*

   : echo a*c .....> folders starting with a and ending with c



---------Redirection----------

The rediection command > will works only for std.i/p not to error messages

But we can store errors using number notations.

: no.0 : std input
: no.1: std o/p
: no.2 : std error



Values assigned in kernal cannot be accessed in bash, but it can be done after exporting the folder.

: a = 1
: $a = 1

: bash
: $a = a

:export a
:bash
:$a = 1








(echo $a)
